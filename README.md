## 🌆 Overview
This project is a **Futuristic City Simulation** developed using **C++ with OpenGL and FreeGLUT**. It showcases a modern city environment featuring **futuristic buildings, flying cars, advanced road systems, and day-night transitions**. The city is designed to reflect a high-tech future with electric charging stations, neon-lit streets, and sci-fi-inspired architecture.

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Day & Night Mode** - The scene transitions smoothly between day and night.  
✅ **Futuristic Vehicles** - High-speed futuristic cars with sleek designs.  
✅ **Flying Cars** - Some vehicles hover above the ground, representing the future of transportation.  
✅ **Smart Traffic Lights** - Traffic lights change colors to control the movement of vehicles.  
✅ **Street Lamps & Road Lights** - Lights turn on at night to illuminate the streets.  
✅ **Electric Car Charging Points** - Charging stations for electric vehicles.  
✅ **Moving Clouds** - Clouds move dynamically across the sky.  
✅ **Benches & Bus Stops** - Public seating areas and bus stops are included.  
✅ **Moving Escalator Beside the Road** - A futuristic pedestrian escalator system.  
✅ **Sun & Moon Transition** - A smooth transition between the sun (day) and moon (night).
